# Lab 03 MITRE ATT&CK Workshop

## Learning Outcomes

* Describe potential system attacks and the actors that might perform them (NDF)
* Describe Defense in Depth and various other network defense methodologies (NDF)
* Explain how network defense tools are used to defend against attacks and mitigate vulnerabilities (NDF)

## Introduction

During class we had the opportunity to go over the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix and Navigator and now we have the chance to work through the workshop. It is important to understand and be able to describe various attacks that occur on a system and the ways adversaries use to break into and exploit systems. 


## Lab Procedure

1) Work through the [MITRE Workshop Videos]
2) Take some time to complete the exercises associated with Module 2-5
  * Review Cobalt Kitty
  * Review APT39

## Lab Report

There is no formal report associated with this lab however be comfortable:
* Reviewing threat intel reports
* Reviewing local raw endpoint or network data
* Using above to identify behaviors 
* Be able map behaviors to tactics 
* Identify and catalog techniques
* Developing ATT&CK Layers based on findings
* Synthesize defensive recommendations for a customer
